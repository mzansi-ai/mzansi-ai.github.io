# So many choices!

The upcoming 2024 National Elections are interesting enough without the Large Language Model and AI innovation acceleration of late.
This lead to a hypothesis: "Can AIs help us ask questions of political parties and their manifestos?"

### The problem:
South Africa has the following political party stats according to the IEC:

#### Parties by registration:
Deregistered - 801
Registered - 1743
Rejected - 94

#### Parties by registraiton level:
National - 774
Municipal - 1864

If filter the parties down to both registered and national you still have 381 to choose from if elligble. On top of this South African electoral law now allows for
independent candidates. According to the IEC NPE 2024 list there are 62 Unique political parties on the list and 497 canididates that could become MPs in parlaiment.

For the average South African voter this a lot of choice. Now some might read manifestos, and there you are spoilt with information too. With manifesto page counts running up to 260 pages:

Thats a lot of reading for a single X next to a party or independent.

## Solution
What if we could give some of the heavy lifting to AI. Open Source Large Language Models are very adept at summarising large pieces of text and giving concise answers.
