# Roadmap aka Mzansi AI landscape

Much like the image generate by OpenAI's DALL-E, we believe South Africa has a bright future within AI and specifically Large Language Models.
South Africa  is a nation of many languages, diversity innovation and grit overcoming all. We would like to build part of that future with the following roadmap.

We personally loathe terms like GPU-poor in the new AI gold rush, we believe South Africa is language, knowledge and innovation rich, so we can compete in our own South African way.

* Public API
* B2B platform for building Mzansi chat and AI experiences to reach all
* Embedding model for all South African official languages
* Embedding Model for Southern African languages
* LLM fine-tuned to South Africa 11 official languages
* Multi-Modal on our 12th official language; sign-language
* Chatbots for public government data like our acts, constitution services, etc.
* Local multilingual and locally hosted document storage.
* LLM translation services.
